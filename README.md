# assignLOs
During my first year of medical school, each Case-Based Learning (CBL) group was tasked with meeting a number of "Learning Objectives" (LOs). CBL groups predominantly decided to meet the objectives by equitably dividing the LOs amongst group members, who would each then research the LO and upload their findings to the group's shared document repository.
In order to quickly and equitably assign LOs, I created this tool.

Given a list of people and a number of LOs, this tool randomly assigns group members to LOs.
